# iis_webapp

In order to run this program, you will need to first run the server program on one terminal before starting the client program on another.

# Server Side

To run the server program, make sure the proper packages are installed in the server folder:
```
pg
cors
express
```
you will also need to install nodemon globally, which you can do with this command:
`npm install -g nodemon`

to run the server, navigate to the server folder and run:
`nodemon index`

once you see that the server has started on port 5000, you can open a new terminal for the client side.

# Client Side

To run the client program, you will need to navigate to the client folder, and then run `npm start`.
After awhile you'll see the React application open up in your browser.
